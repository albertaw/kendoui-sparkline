# Kendo UI Sparkline for Vue

##  Overview

A sparkline is a condensed version of a chart that shows a high-level overview of the data with minimal details. Its smaller size allows it to be embedded within text, spreadsheets, or other graphics. The Kendo UI sparkline component can be visualized as a line chart, bar chart, or pie chart.
