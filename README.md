# Kendo UI Sparkline for Vue

##  Overview

A sparkline is a condensed version of a chart that shows a high-level overview of the data with minimal details. Its smaller size allows it to be embedded within text, spreadsheets, or other graphics. The Kendo UI sparkline component can be visualized as a line graph, bar chart, or pie chart. This demo uses data from a stock API to show historical volume and price information for Apple stock.
